# folio-react

## Description
 - Hey hey! This is a portfolio I created for myself, powered by React! I hope you like it.

  

## Technology Used
This web application follows proper MVC file and directory structure formating. Sequelize, mysql2, express, dotenv, and bcrypt are dependencies that allow this application to run. It also employs the use of handlebars.js and Pico CSS in order to render templated webpages and give them a polished look. The sharp npm package is used to render an image for the application.
